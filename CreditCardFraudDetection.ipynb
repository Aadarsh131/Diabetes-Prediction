scores, indicating their effectiveness in correctly identifying fraudulent transactions and minimizing false positives. While Decision Tree shows a slightly lower accuracy, its balanced precision and recall suggest it's a reasonable choice. Random Forest also performs well but falls slightly short of Logistic Regression and SVM. In real-world credit card fraud detection, prioritizing precision to reduce false positives is crucial to minimize the financial burden on customers.
